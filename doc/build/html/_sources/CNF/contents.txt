**Title**

Simulations of Flame-Vortex Interactions

**Authors**

Christopher J. Rutland and Joel H. Ferziger


**Summary**

Full numerical simulations to study the interaction of a vortex and a premixed flame as a model problem. The effects of heat release and the importance of the relative length and time scales of the vortex and flames are examined. Changes in the internal structure and overall shape of the flame are studied.

Different approaches are studied to isolate various effects and aid in understand the full interaction.

(1) Frozen flame

(2) Frozen vortex

(3) Full flame-vortex interaction: combination of above two frozen cases
